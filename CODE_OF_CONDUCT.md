# Our Code of Conduct

## Hacker Ethics and Our Pledge

In the interest of _fostering an respectful, libre, and open source environment,_ we as hackers,
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for anyone. Respect has great importance in everyday life. Calls to respect this or that are increasingly part of public life:

- environmentalists exhort us to respect nature.
- foes of abortion and capital punishment insist on respect for human life.
- members of racial and ethnic minorities and those discriminated against because of their gender, sexual orientation, age, religious beliefs.
- economic status demand respect both as social and moral equals and for their cultural differences.

It is widely acknowledged that **public debates about such demands should take place under terms of mutual respect**. We may learn both that our lives together go better when we respect the things that deserve to be respected.[[1]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/respect/) Hackers can come in many forms, many undertakings might now be considered variants of hacking, from modding cars to crafting to do-it-yourself projects.

**We don’t care if you’re liberal or conservative, Black or white, straight or gay, or anything in between!** In fact, we won’t bring it up, or ask. **We simply do not care.** **This is a place to experiment with and then practice leaving behind categories of social difference while remaining respectful.** We all make mistakes, overstep ourselves at times, introduce bugs, bring down production, lie in our documentation, get frustrated, implement dark UI patterns, or any number of other mistakes, but when we get called out, we will make the choice to try and understand the others point of view rather than attacking or trying to ruin someones life. This is an open-technology community that aims to be a space of refuge for any participants, a space of sanctuary. From programmers, to translators, designers, writers and beyond, we will all seek to understand how and why things are the way they are before catalyzing or proposing a transition to a future state.

We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonwealth, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). 

## Our Standards - The ethical principles of hacking - motivation and limits

* Accept constructive criticism and be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences while showing empathy towards other.
* Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world really works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their acting, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, gender, race, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.
* Don't litter other people's data.
* Make public data available, protect private data.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of any mistakes in behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
