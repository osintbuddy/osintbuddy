  ## Introducing OSINTBuddy

  <p>
      Welcome to the OSINTBuddy project where you can connect, combine,
      and get insight from unstructured and public data as results that
      can be explored step-by-step. An easy-to-use plugin system allows any
      Python developer to quickly integrate new data sources so you can focus 
      on discovering, interacting, and visualizing what's important to you
  </p>

### What is <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://osintbuddy.com">osintbuddy.com</a>?


Not much, yet.


But here's the concept:


An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. These data sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:

- Public government data
- Media *(newspapers, magazines, radio)*
- Internet *(blogs, discussion groups, citizen media, etc)*
- Professional and academic publications *(budgets, hearings, telephone directories, websites, etc)*
- Commercial data *(commercial imagery, financial assessments, databases, etc)*
- Grey literature *(technical reports, preprints, patents, business documents, etc)*


OSINT is a method of working with, assessing and ranking information ‚Äî We are living in the [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and the volume of information OSINT research has to deal with [(information explosion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion) and the issue of low quality data leaves researchers drowning. The majority of this data is unstructured introducing many challenges to analyzing it and producing actionable intelligence since most data analytics databases are designed for structured data. We are surrounded by information and nearly none of it is useful. 


We've decided to do something about it. The rapid developments in technologies such as AI and big data analytics have opened new horizons for OSINT which weren't previously available. We want to put all of that information at your fingertips. We want actionable intelligence quickly and to the point, that's why we're building an open-source OSINT tool that's free. Free to use, free to modify, free to do with as you wish, and built with plain old web technologies anyone can learn. But this isn't really the project. This is a free new community. A community for OSINT enthusiasts around the world and we need your help to design it, to program it, and to build it. We want to hear your suggestions, your ideas, and we're going to build it right in front of your eyes. The notion of a ‚Äúneedle in a haystack‚Äù is taken to the extreme on the internet. Let's build a magnet.


### Key Alpha Features
- Visual representation and layout modes for fetched data for easy understanding and editing. 
- Simplified data fetching/transformations from custom sources using Python plugins, custom plugin/entity field layouts, check out the [osintbuddy](https://pypi.org/project/osintbuddy/) PyPi package for more details and expect many more input fields like files and checkboxes/toggles to come in the future.
- Open for contributions.
- Works most of the time :)


## Getting Started


> [!CAUTION] 
> Not ready for use! If you're interested in development you'll need the `plugins` docker service cloned: `git clone https://github.com/osintbuddy/plugins osintbuddy-plugins` and the plugins initialized through `ob init`

To start using OSINTBuddy, follow these simple installation steps:

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and submodules
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/osintbuddy/osintbuddy.git
   cd osintbuddy
   # using ssh?
   # git clone git@github.com:osintbuddy/osintbuddy.git 
   ```

2. [Install Docker & Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

3. [Initialize core plugins](https://github.com/osintbuddy/plugins/blob/main/src/osintbuddy/ob.py#L85) for OSINTBuddy and start [the stack](https://github.com/osintbuddy/osintbuddy/blob/main/docker-compose.yml):
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   . ./venv/bin/activate
   pip install ./osintbuddy-plugins/
   ob init
   docker compose up db ui
   ```

- URLs
  - Frontend: *`http://localhost:5173`*
  - Docs: *`http://localhost:5173/docs/overview`*
  - Backend: *`http://localhost:48997/api`*

Access OSINTBuddy through the URLs provided for the frontend, backend, and documentation.


## Introducing the Rust Rewrite

Welcome to the Rust backend! OSINTBuddy is a platform that helps you dig through the internet for information. Originally built in Python, this Rust rewrite exists because I got tired of Python and I decided to rewrite the entire thing to learn Rust. Now it's faster and crashes less *(hopefully)*. 

### Download the latest release 

Once we iron out a few more bugs and a few more features we intend to setup a github actions workflow to build and package up the built frontend and Rust server. Stay tuned...

### Development instructions

1. Install
   ```bash
   cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features native-tls,postgres
   cargo install cargo-watch
   ```

2. Migrate db and build and start web server with watch
   ```bash
   docker compose up db ui
   sqlx migrate run
   # ensure your Python venv with osintbuddy is activated and plugins initialized...
   # . ./venv/bin/activate
   # now we can run and watch the Rust server
   cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x run
   ```

3. Visit the app
   - frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - backend: http://localhost:48997/api
