  ## Introducing OSINTBuddy

  <p>
      Welcome to the OSINTBuddy project where you can connect, combine,
      and get insight from unstructured and public data as results that
      can be explored step-by-step. An easy-to-use plugin system allows any
      Python developer to quickly integrate new data sources so you can focus 
      on discovering, interacting, and visualizing what's important to you

### What is <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://osintbuddy.com">osintbuddy.com</a>?


Not much, yet. 


But here's the concept:

An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. These data sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:


- Public government data
- Media *(newspapers, magazines, radio)*
- Internet *(blogs, discussion groups, citizen media, etc)*
- Professional and academic publications *(budgets, hearings, telephone directories, websites, etc)*
- Commercial data *(commercial imagery, financial assessments, databases, etc)*
- Grey literature *(technical reports, preprints, patents, business documents, etc)*


OSINT is a method of working with, assessing and ranking information ‚Äî We are living in the [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and the volume of information OSINT research has to deal with *[(information explosion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion)* and the issue of low quality data leaves researchers drowning. The majority of this data is unstructured introducing many challenges to analyzing it and producing actionable intelligence since most data analytics databases are designed for structured data. We are surrounded by information and nearly none of it is useful. 


I've decided to do something about it. The rapid developments in technologies such as AI and big data analytics have opened new horizons for OSINT which weren't previously available. We want to put all of that information at your fingertips. We want actionable intelligence quickly and to the point, that's why we're building an open-source OSINT tool that's free. Free to use, free to modify, free to do with as you wish, and built with plain old web technologies anyone can learn. But this isn't really the project.


It's been three decades since its inception and the internets only proved to be a mirror of us, our society and politics. We face a series of significant challenges that directly threaten democratic values and processes. The spread of disinformation and misinformation, amplified by algorithms designed to prioritize engagement over truth, erodes trust in institutions and fuels social division. Online "echo chambers" and filter bubbles reinforce existing biases, increasing political polarization and hindering constructive dialogue. Big Tech monopolies shape our digital lives and authoritarianism gains ground, the question of who owns, designs, and controls technology has never been more urgent. 


What are the technical frameworks that ensure that a technology is open and equitable; how do we ‚Äúreconfigure‚Äù digital infrastructures to serve positive social transformation rather than corporate interests? This is a new chance for a truly free open source OSINT tool to be created for  enthusiasts around the world to fight back against these issues and we need your help to design it, to program it, and to build it. We want to hear your suggestions, your ideas, and we're going to build it right in front of your eyes. The notion of a ‚Äúneedle in a haystack‚Äù is taken to the extreme on the internet. Let's build a magnet.


### Project Status

> [!CAUTION] 
>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Software (Alpha) ‚ö†Ô∏è** 
>
> OSINTBuddy is currently experimental software. It's not quite ready for use *yet*! If you're interested in development you'll need the `plugins` docker service cloned: `git clone https://github.com/osintbuddy/plugins osintbuddy-plugins` to the root of this repo

| Repository | Description | Language | ETA |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----|
| [`osintbuddy`](https://github.com/osintbuddy/osintbuddy) |The main web application and backend *(you are here)* | Rust, TypeScript/Preact | 3-6 months from alpha |
| [`plugins`](https://github.com/osintbuddy/plugins) | the Python plugin system package that's on PyPi | Python | 3-6 months |
| [`entities`](https://github.com/osintbuddy/entities) | The default OSIB entity definitions | Python | 4-7 months |

### Key Alpha Features

- **Visual Intelligence Made Simple**: Intuitive graph-based interface transforms complex data relationships into clear, interactive visualizations.
- **Extensible Plugin Architecture**: a Python-based plugin system allows custom entities to pull from any data source.
- **Self-hosted**: Your data can stay under your control with full privacy and security
- **Cost-Effective**: Ditch the enterprise pricing, access advanced OSINT capabilities with free open source software.
- **Open for contributions**.
- ~~Works most of the time :)~~ We're currently in the process of finishing up the rewrite, stay tuned!
- And check out the [open issues](https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy/issues) for a list of requested features (and known bugs).


## A Vision

We aspire to become more than just a data aggregation tool:

- **Collective Intelligence** - Collaborative workspaces for global knowledge sharing
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Automated insights and pattern detection
- **History Graphs** - Browser extension for seamless web exploration
- **AI Integration** - Swarm intelligence, sentiment analysis, and evolutionary algorithms





### Download the latest release 

Once we iron out a few more bugs and a few more features we intend to setup a github actions workflow to build and package up the built frontend and Rust server. Stay tuned...


### Development

This Rust rewrite exists because I got tired of Python and I decided to rewrite the entire thing to learn Rust. Now it's faster and crashes less *(hopefully)*. 

If you want to start developing for OSINTBuddy, create or pick up an [issue](https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy/issues) and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/osintbuddy/osintbuddy.git
   cd osintbuddy
   # using ssh?
   # git clone git@github.com:osintbuddy/osintbuddy.git 
   ```

2. [Install Docker & Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

3. [Initialize core plugins](https://github.com/osintbuddy/plugins/blob/main/src/osintbuddy/ob.py#L85) for OSINTBuddy and start [the stack](https://github.com/osintbuddy/osintbuddy/blob/main/docker-compose.yml):
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   . ./venv/bin/activate
   pip install ./osintbuddy-plugins/
   ob init

   ```
4. Start the stack
  ```
  docker compose up db ui
  ```

5. Migrate db and build and start web server with watch
   ```bash
   cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features native-tls,postgres
   cargo install cargo-watch
   sqlx migrate run
   # ensure your Python venv with osintbuddy is activated and the default plugins initialized...
   # . ./venv/bin/activate
   # now we can run and watch the Rust server
   cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x run
   ```

6. Access OSINTBuddy through the URLs provided for the frontend, backend, and documentation.

- URLs
  - Frontend: [`http://localhost:56173`](http://localhost:56173)
  - Docs: [`http://localhost:55173/docs/overview`](http://localhost:55173/docs/overview)
  - Backend: [`http://localhost:48997/api`](http://localhost:48997/api)
