---


OSINTBuddy changes how you can interact with [open source intelligence](https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-open-source-intelligence/) *(OSINT)* and the internet through visual discovery. Being able to transform scattered data points into actionable intelligence networks, enables you to map relationships, identify patterns, and uncover insights that traditional methods can miss. 

One of the key features of 
OSINTBuddy is its plugin system which allows researchers to easily add or modify Python plugins _(also referred to as "entities")_ to suit their specific needs. This system provides a flexible and customizable approach to data gathering and analysis, making it an alternative to popular proprietary tools such as [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/) or [i2 Analyst's Notebook](https://i2group.com/solutions/i2-analysts-notebook).

## The Benefits of an Open-Source Alternative

As an open-source project, OSINTBuddy offers several advantages over proprietary tools like [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/). The most significant of these is the ability for users to actively participate in the development process, [suggesting improvements, reporting bugs,](/docs/contrib/bugs-security) and [contributing their own plugins and enhancements](/docs/ref/registry-api).

Moreover, as an open-source project, OSINTBuddy is freely available to all, lowering the barriers to entry for individuals and organizations seeking to leverage the power of OSINT in their work. This democratizes access to powerful intelligence-gathering tools and fosters a more diverse and inclusive community of practitioners.
