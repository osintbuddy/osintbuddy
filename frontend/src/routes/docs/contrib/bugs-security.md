Help us keep OSINTBuddy secure and stable by reporting issues you encounter. Your contributions help improve the platform for the entire community.

{% callout type="info" title="Found a security issue?" %}
Please report it responsibly. Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. We want to prevent exploitation and protect active users. Private reporting gives us time to verify and understand the issue and develop a proper fix.

## Reporting Bugs
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/osintbuddy/osintbuddy/issues/new?assignees=jerlendds&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=&title=%5BBUG%5D+); it's that easy! **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Error logs wrapped in code blocks
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

We *love* thorough bug reports!

## Reporting Security Issues


Please email the core contributors directly at [oss@osintbuddy.com](mailto:oss@osintbuddy.com) if you encounter a serious security issue such as:

- Vulnerbilities in dependencies or third-party packages

- Unauthorized data access or privilege escalation

- Plugin sandbox escape or unintended code execution vulnerabilities

- Authentication or authorization bypasses

- Data leakage or privacy violations

- or any other issues that could compromise user data or system integrity.
