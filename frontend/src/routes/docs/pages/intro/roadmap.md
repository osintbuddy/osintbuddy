## OSINTBuddy Roadmap

OSINTBuddy is a project driven by my passion for data extraction, graphs, visualization, and analysis. With the rewrite I'm prioritizing a solid core experience and continually exploring new technologies and approaches on the side to see what should be integrated into this web app.

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the future development plans for OSINTBuddy, including features currently under development, and completed functionalities. OSINTBuddy is first and foremost a project for me to play with web tech, graphs, plugins, and OSINT crawling *(this is just for fun, won’t be big and professional like Maltego)*.

### 2. Completed Functionalities

OSINTBuddy was started Aug 25, 2021.

| Version | Functionality | Date |
|---------|---------------|------|
| 0.3.0   | Completed the rewrite to Rust and Vite/preact | pending  |
