OSINTBuddy was born out of a passion for web crawling, data extraction, graphs, visualization, and analysis. I wanted a powerful, user-friendly tool that simplified data collection and analysis. At the core of this project lies a far more ambitious vision than the mere creation of an all-in-one data aggregation and analysis tool.

## A potential future

 What we aspire to start is the birth of a community, passionately dedicated to the development of an evolving intelligence tool - a system and platform designed for discovering, interacting, and visualizing information to derive actionable insights. We imagine a system that not only learns from and evolves with your skills but also augments them. Here are some of our ideas for the future in no particular order...


### Intuitive search and discovery tools

We want you to be able to interact with our algorithms, filter, segment, search for particular data, apply advanced query filters, data layouts, build queries visually, and more so you can uncover insights that matter via an easy-to-navigate web-based interface.


### Collective intelligence through collaborative workspaces

We want to create a platform that [promotes](https://cci.mit.edu/) [collective intelligence](https://www.cip.org/whitepaper). Think of the currently popular collaborative workspaces such as [AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE), [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq), or even [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but built into our data workspace. Imagine a system where each individual user contributes to the pool of knowledge, where you can share your graphs, where you can track changes with annotations and comments, where insights from your workspaces can be published and engaged with by our global community, the world wide web. Where every connection made, every data source integrated, every plugin created and shared helps propel you forward with insights from around the world. 


### Real-time monitoring

We want functionality that can provide 'real-time' information for a set of entities or topics, notifying you when theres new data, changes, and or emerging patterns in your field of interest. Automatically retrieve insights as time goes on and learn from history with snapshots of your past data.


### History graphs

We want to create a browser extension that allows you to seamlessly browse the web while also populating your OSINTBuddy graph. Each website you visit is mapped as an entity, with edges connecting them in the sequence you’ve traveled. Not just a bookmark list or a history tab, the history graph could maintain the context, showing not just where you’ve been, but also how and when you got there, and with the ability to extract a comment or piece of data out of a website you visit into an entity, you'll rarely have to leave your web browser. 


### AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms

Integrating [AI](https://ollama.com/), [swarm intelligence](https://ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-10-5-1-134-141.pdf), and [evolutionary algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1425193) could let us create a tool that can continually evolve and optimize your operations over time. From NLP and sentiment analysis to anomaly detection and more, bringing data science tools and techniques to OSINTBuddy could let use create a powerful tool that reveals deep insights among a "haystack" of noisy information.

This is a project that will most likely not be finished for many years if ever, and that will require collaboration among experts in many fields. We're always looking for help, from writing documentation, researching feature ideas, designing the UX/UI, donating, to simply marketing and sharing the project, anything you contribute helps realize a vision for what could turn into a cross-disciplinary toolkit for working with information. Will you join me?
