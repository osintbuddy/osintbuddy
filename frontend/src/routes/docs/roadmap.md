OSINTBuddy is first and foremost a project driven by my passion for data extraction, graphs, visualization, and analysis. With the rewrite I'm prioritizing a solid core experience and continually exploring new technologies and approaches on the side to see what could be integrated into this app *(this is just for fun, there's no promises this will be big and professional, like Maltego)*. 

## History

{% timelines %}

{% timeline title="An Idea Takes Flight" description="OSINTBuddy as you know it didn't exist yet. The project started off as a poorly made Google CSE crawler, born out of a personal curiosity for web data exploration." /%}


{% timeline title="Emerging into a Prototype, Graphs, and Dreaming of Browser IDEs (v. Alpha)" description=" When I first launched, back in 2021, I was a new open-source contributor with a big idea: creating a modern, open-source, user-friendly intelligence tool. I had no formal training in web development, no background in architecture, and no clue what I was doing. What I did have was curiosity, persistence, and ambition. So, I took the leap and dove in. The concept of a browser-based OSINT tool, inspired by projects like Maltego, began to take shape. The goal was to create an intuitive environment for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data." releaseDate="August 12th, 2023" downloadLink="https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"  /%}
