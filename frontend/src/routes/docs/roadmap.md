## OSINTBuddy Roadmap

OSINTBuddy is first and foremost a project driven by my passion for data extraction, graphs, visualization, and analysis. With the rewrite I'm prioritizing a solid core experience and continually exploring new technologies and approaches on the side to see what could be integrated into this app *(this is just for fun, wonâ€™t be big and professional like Maltego)*.
